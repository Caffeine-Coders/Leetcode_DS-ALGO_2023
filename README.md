## Problems & solutions

| # | Title | Solution | Description | Problem Link |
|---| ----- | :--------: | :------------ | :------------ |
| 1 | Two Sum | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/78bda0306e21f98dff5c28c479029acfee540d88/Two%20Sum.java) | Create a Map that stores the difference of each number from the target and the index of that number in the array. Then search for the target in the array, if it's there, then that key value pair is my two sum solution | [Two Sum on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) |
| 2 | Palindrome | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/tree/c3763a44729765b99906a53125c9bfa3710cfb47) | Convert the given integer to a character array and then run a pointer from the beggining as well as the end and then check if all the characters match, if they don't at some point, it's not a palindrome | [Palindrome Number on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) |
