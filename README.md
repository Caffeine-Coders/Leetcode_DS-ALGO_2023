## Problems & solutions

| # | Title | Solution | Description | Problem Link |
|---| ----- | :--------: | :------------ | :------------ |
| 1 | Two Sum | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/78bda0306e21f98dff5c28c479029acfee540d88/Two%20Sum.java) | Create a Map that stores the difference of each number from the target and the index of that number in the array. Then search for the target in the array, if it's there, then that key-value pair is my two-sum solution | [Two Sum on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) |
| 2 | Palindrome | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/tree/c3763a44729765b99906a53125c9bfa3710cfb47) | Copy the given integer to a temp and Modulus the temp variable and keep adding the digit obtained to the reversed integer and then divide the temp by 10. After the loop, compare given and reversed integers and if they are equal, it's a palindrome. | [Palindrome Number on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) |
| 3 | Roman to Integer | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/65295277d773114b35c17590a08e251ccabc5c89/RomanToInteger) | Run a for loop and then convert the given string to a character array and then convert each index's value to an integer from roman and then check if the current element is greater than the previous element, if it is, then subtract the previous from the current integer and then subtract the current integer again to remove previously added previous integer, else add the current element to the solution. | [Roman to Integer on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/) |
| 4 | Longest Common Prefix | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/b95392128c4930a53649808813eace11502e768d/Longest%20Common%20Prefix) | Select the first string from the array of strings and call this the prefix. Then keep checking if the index of this prefix is 0 in a string out of the strings one by one. If in current string it turns out to be at index 0, then move to the next string. After the for loop, you'll have the prefix. | [Longest Common Prefix on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/) |
| 5 | Valid Parenthesis | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/tree/894f63be9091aa75a880287a256e09caa23dccd3) | Keep adding each character to stack and then if the stack is not empty, check if it's a closing parenthesis. If it is, seek the stack's top element and check if it's the opening bracket of the same bracket and then if it is, pop the stack. At the end check if stack is empty, then it's valid otherwise it's not. | [Valid Parenthesis on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/) |
| 6 | Merge two sorted lists | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/d62f1282abd29d863212ce81a2b849b823ba02d6/Merge%20Two%20Sorted%20Lists.java) | Create a new list node and then run a while loop which doesnt end until list1 & list2 are both null. Now keep checking if list1's current val is greater or equal than list2's val in which case, in the newly created list, add list1's val and then increment the appropriate pointers and do the opposite if list2 is greater than list1. At the end add all the remaining list1 or list2 node's because one of the list got exhausted and the while loop didn't consider the rest of the values of the other list so just append them. | [Merge Two Sorted Lists on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) |
| 7 | Remove duplicates from sorted array | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/3858ab2610823121af0222568ae05a11636b5f9b/Remove%20Duplicates%20from%20Sorted%20Array.java) | Initialize a pointer with value 0 and then run a for loop that checks each element of the array with the previous element, if they are not equal, then change the pointer numbered index in the array to the current element and then increment the pointer by 1. Basically, the pointer maintains the position where next unique element is to be entered. | [Remove Duplicates on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/) |
| 8 | Remove Element from Array | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/55522d11e14bf99e790f31047cbbcbc650fb57dd/Remove%20Element.java) | Initialize an integer = 0 which will represent the new unique array's length. Let's call this integer newLength. Run the for loop, as soon as you find an element that is not equal to the given val, place that element in the array's new length index basically saying that we have found one more unique element for the new array. At the end return the newLength.| [Remove Element on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/) |
| 9 | First Occurrence in a string | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/d64772b89609680c0e7f74d2bbd94bf65f256daa/First%20Occurrence%20of%20a%20String.java) | Run a for loop for the size of the haystack string, at each index, compare the substring of haystack with needle and if it does not match then move to the next index in the string. if you find it, return the value of current index. Otherwise return -1. | [First Occurence in a string](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/) |
| 10 | Search Insert Index | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/2ec5d54a4aa7048a50622288757396b1c6001073/Search%20Insert%20Position.java) | An O(log n) solution is to perform a binary search on the given array and if the element is found, just return the index, if it's not, return the left index because that's where the element smaller to the target is. An O(n) solution is to check all the boundary cases in the for loop: 1) If it's a match, just return the current index. 2) If it's the first index & the value is greater than the target then return 0. 3) If it's in the middle of the array, check if it's greater than the current value and lower than the next value then return the next index. 4) If it's the last index, and you still haven't satisfied any of the above cases, return the last index + 1. | [Search Insert Index on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/) |
| 11 | Length of the Last Word | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/976a7e20faad4f93bec6994cc5ae1a80b4a2f9fc/Length%20of%20Last%20Word.java) | Initialize a flag to 0, Start from the end of the string and compare each character to an empty space. If it's not an empty space, it will mark the flag as 1(which means that the last word has started) and increment the length variable declared. Now check if the flag is 1 and if an empty space is encountered that means the last word has ended. so return the length. | [Length of the Last Word on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/submissions/) |
