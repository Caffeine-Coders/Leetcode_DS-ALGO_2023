## Problems & solutions

| # | Title | Solution | Description | Problem Link |
|---| ----- | :--------: | :------------ | :------------ |
| 1 | Two Sum | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/blob/78bda0306e21f98dff5c28c479029acfee540d88/Two%20Sum.java) | Create a Map that stores the difference of each number from the target and the index of that number in the array. Then search for the target in the array, if it's there, then that key value pair is my two sum solution | [Two Sum on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) |
| 2 | Palindrome | [Java](https://github.com/anudeep-17/Leetcode_DS-ALGO_2023/tree/c3763a44729765b99906a53125c9bfa3710cfb47) | Copy the given integer to a temp and Modulus the temp variable and keep adding the digit obtained to the reversed integer and then divide the temp by 10. After the loop, compare given and reversed integer and if they are equal, it's a palindrome. | [Palindrome Number on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) |
